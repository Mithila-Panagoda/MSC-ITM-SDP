### Development Guidelines

- Ensure that your code is well-documented and follows the project's [Style Guide](#style-guide).
- Write tests for your code and ensure that all tests pass before submitting a pull request.
- Keep your commits small and focused. Each commit should represent a single logical change.
- Rebase your branch before submitting a pull request to ensure that it is up-to-date with the latest changes in the main branch.

### Style Guide

- Follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide for Python code.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Write clear and concise comments to explain the purpose of your code.
- Ensure that your code is properly formatted and linted.

## Conventional Commits

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for commit messages to improve collaboration, code readability, and automated changelog generation. Hereâ€™s a quick summary:

- **Format**: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
- **Types**:
  - `feat`: New feature
  - `fix`: Bugfix
  - `docs`: Documentation updates
  - `style`: Code style changes (e.g., formatting, no logic changes)
  - `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
  - `test`: Adding or modifying tests
  - `chore`: Maintenance or meta tasks
- **Scope**: (Optional) Context of the change (e.g., `auth`, `ui`, `api`)
